# Stock-Prediction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Stock Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models! This project focuses on developing a robust and accurate stock price prediction system leveraging deep learning techniques. LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is employed to capture temporal patterns and make reliable predictions in the dynamic world of financial markets. The dataset is used from yahoo finance. 

ðŸ“Š Features and Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming historical stock price data to ensure it is suitable for training the LSTM model.

Time Series Analysis: Conducting exploratory analysis to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the historical stock price data.

LSTM Model Architecture: Implementing an LSTM-based neural network, a powerful deep learning model for sequential data prediction.

Feature Engineering: Designing relevant features, such as technical indicators, to enhance the predictive power of the LSTM model.

Model Training and Validation: Splitting the data into training and validation sets to train and fine-tune the LSTM model for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy and performance of the LSTM model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Prediction Visualization: Visualizing the predicted stock price alongside the actual data to gain insights into the model's performance.
